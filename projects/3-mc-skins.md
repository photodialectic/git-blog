# MC-Skins: Minecraft Skin Editor

A NextJS/React application that provides pixel-level Minecraft skin editing with real-time 3D preview and community sharing features.

## Overview

Built for the Minecraft community, this skin editor allows users to create and modify Minecraft character skins with precision. The application demonstrates advanced canvas manipulation, 3D rendering, and real-time collaborative features within a web browser.

## Key Features

### Pixel Art Editor
- **Canvas-Based Editing**: Precise pixel-level control using HTML5 Canvas
- **Layer Management**: Separate base and overlay layers for complex skin designs
- **Color Palette**: Custom color picker with Minecraft-appropriate color suggestions
- **Drawing Tools**: Brush, pencil, fill bucket, and eyedropper tools
- **Undo/Redo System**: Full edit history with keyboard shortcuts

### 3D Preview System
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Live 3D character model updates as you edit
- **Multiple Views**: Front, back, side, and rotating views of the character
- **Animation Support**: Character poses and walking animations
- **Lighting Controls**: Adjustable lighting to preview skin appearance in-game

### Skin Management
- **Save & Load**: Persistent skin storage with user accounts
- **Import/Export**: Support for standard Minecraft skin file formats (.png)
- **Template Library**: Pre-built templates and base skins to start from
- **Version History**: Track changes and revert to previous versions

## Technical Implementation

### Canvas Architecture
```
components/PixelPainter/
└── index.js              # Main canvas editor with tool system

components/Preview/
└── index.js              # 3D model rendering and animation

utils/
├── skinData.js           # Skin format conversion utilities
└── rendering.js          # 3D model geometry and texturing
```

### Pixel Manipulation System
The editor uses a layered canvas approach:
- **Base Layer**: Primary skin pixels (Steve/Alex model support)
- **Overlay Layer**: Additional details like jackets, hats, sleeves
- **Preview Integration**: Real-time texture mapping to 3D model
- **Format Conversion**: Automatic conversion between skin format versions

### 3D Rendering Pipeline
```javascript
// 3D model system
const skinRenderer = {
  loadModel: (skinData) => { /* Parse Minecraft skin format */ },
  applyTexture: (canvas) => { /* Map 2D pixels to 3D surfaces */ },
  animate: (pose) => { /* Character animation system */ },
  render: (scene) => { /* WebGL rendering pipeline */ }
}
```

### Authentication & Storage
- **User Accounts**: Auth0 integration for personal skin libraries
- **Database Storage**: MySQL backend for skin metadata and sharing
- **File Management**: Secure skin file upload and retrieval
- **Community Features**: Public gallery and skin sharing system

## Development Challenges

### Pixel-Perfect Editing
Minecraft skins require precise pixel placement:
- **Zoom Controls**: Multiple zoom levels for detailed work
- **Grid Overlay**: Optional pixel grid for alignment
- **Touch Support**: Mobile-friendly editing with touch gestures
- **Performance**: Smooth editing even with complex brush operations

### 3D Model Accuracy
Ensuring the preview matches in-game appearance:
- **Minecraft Geometry**: Accurate replication of character model dimensions
- **Texture Mapping**: Proper UV mapping for all model faces
- **Lighting Model**: Realistic lighting that matches game environment
- **Animation System**: Character poses and movement animations

### File Format Compatibility
Supporting multiple Minecraft skin formats:
- **Legacy Format**: 64x32 pixel classic skins
- **Modern Format**: 64x64 pixel skins with overlay support
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatic format recognition and conversion
- **Export Options**: Multiple format exports for different Minecraft versions

## User Interface Design

### Editor Layout
- **Tool Palette**: Left sidebar with drawing tools and options
- **Canvas Area**: Center stage with zoom and pan controls  
- **3D Preview**: Right panel with rotating character model
- **Color Controls**: Bottom panel with color picker and palette

### Responsive Design
The editor adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full multi-panel layout with all tools visible
- **Tablet**: Collapsible panels with touch-optimized controls
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with swipe navigation between editor and preview

## Performance Optimization

### Canvas Rendering
- **Efficient Redraws**: Only redraw changed regions for smooth editing
- **Layer Compositing**: Hardware-accelerated layer blending
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of canvas contexts and textures

### 3D Rendering
- **WebGL Optimization**: Efficient vertex buffers and texture management
- **Frame Rate Control**: Maintain 60fps during real-time preview updates
- **Resource Loading**: Progressive loading of 3D assets and textures

## Community Integration

### Sharing Features
- **Public Gallery**: Browse community-created skins
- **Rating System**: Community voting on skin quality
- **Search & Filter**: Find skins by style, popularity, or creator
- **Download Statistics**: Track skin popularity and usage

### User Profiles  
- **Skin Portfolio**: Personal gallery of created skins
- **Creation Statistics**: Track editing time and skin variations
- **Social Features**: Follow favorite creators and share creations

The MC-Skins editor combines precise pixel art tools with real-time 3D preview to create an intuitive skin creation experience that rivals desktop applications while running entirely in the browser.
