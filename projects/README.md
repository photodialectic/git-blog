A collection of projects I've built on my HomeStack infrastructure. These range from web applications and APIs to command-line tools and utilities, each serving different purposes in my development workflow and daily life.

All projects are containerized and deployed using my service-oriented architecture, demonstrating practical applications of the HomeStack components covered in other sections.
